## Our Commitment to Your Privacy

ViewLingo is designed with your privacy in mind. We believe that powerful translation tools shouldn't come at the cost of your personal data. That's why ViewLingo operates entirely on your device without collecting, storing, or transmitting any of your information.

## Data Collection

**ViewLingo does not collect any personal data.** 

All translations are processed entirely on your device using macOS built-in translation models. We have no servers, no analytics, and no tracking of any kind.

## Screen Capture

When you use ViewLingo's translation features:

- Screen captures are used solely for text recognition and translation
- All image processing happens locally on your Mac
- Captured images are processed in memory and immediately discarded after text extraction
- No screen data ever leaves your device
- We cannot see what you translate or when you use the app

## Translation History

ViewLingo includes an optional translation history feature for your convenience:

- Translation history is stored locally on your device only
- Screenshots and translated text are saved in your app's local storage
- You have full control to delete individual records or clear all history at any time
- This data is never synced to the cloud or backed up externally
- History data remains on your device even if you delete and reinstall the app
- No one else can access your translation history

## Permissions

ViewLingo requires certain permissions to function:

### Screen Recording Permission
- **Why we need it**: To capture the screen area you want to translate
- **When we use it**: Only when you actively create a viewfinder or use translation features
- **What we don't do**: No background recording, no monitoring when the app isn't in use

The screen recording permission is managed by macOS and can be revoked at any time in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen Recording.

## Third-Party Services

ViewLingo is proudly independent:

- Uses only Apple's built-in macOS frameworks
- No third-party analytics or crash reporting tools
- No external translation APIs or services
- No advertisements or ad networks
- No social media integrations

## Data Security

Since ViewLingo doesn't collect data, there's nothing to secure on our end. Your translation history is protected by:

- macOS app sandboxing
- Your device's built-in security features
- Local storage that's inaccessible to other apps

## Children's Privacy

ViewLingo does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13 years of age.

## Changes to This Policy

If we ever update this privacy policy, we will:
- Update the "Last Updated" date at the top
- Notify users through the app or our GitHub repository
- Never make changes that compromise your privacy

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:
- Delete translation history anytime within the app
- Revoke screen recording permission in System Settings
- Uninstall the app to remove all local data

## Open Source Commitment

While ViewLingo's source code is proprietary, our privacy practices are transparent. This privacy policy is maintained publicly on GitHub for accountability.

## Summary

- **No data collection** - We don't collect anything
- **No internet required** - Everything works offline
- **No tracking** - We don't know who uses our app or how
- **You're in control** - All data stays on your device
