## About ViewLingo

ViewLingo is available on the Mac App Store! Experience AR-style translation on your screen. Simply create a viewfinder over any text, and watch as translations appear naturally overlaid on the original content - perfect for reading foreign websites, watching international videos, or working with multilingual documents.

## Key Features

### Viewfinder Translation
Create a resizable viewfinder that translates any text on your screen with `Control+Shift+A`. The translation appears as a natural overlay, maintaining the context of the original content. Use `fn+Control double-tap` to quickly create a viewfinder with your previous size.

- English, Korean, Japanese, Chinese (Simplified & Traditional)
